# HR Pilot Program

## Overview
The HR Pilot Program is a comprehensive project aimed at improving employee retention. The project involves analyzing a dataset of 15,000 data points, conducting a pilot program for new employees, and using machine learning to predict employee attrition.

## Data Analysis
The first step in the project was to analyze a comprehensive dataset of 15,000 data points. This analysis provided valuable insights into the factors that influence employee retention.

## Pilot Program
A pilot program was conducted for new employees to proactively identify those at risk of leaving. Based on the findings from the data analysis, strategies were formulated to improve employee retention.

## Predictive Modeling
An AutoML model was engineered using PyCaret. The model uses the Decision Tree algorithm to predict new employee attrition with over 95% accuracy. This high level of accuracy allows for effective intervention strategies to be implemented.

## Reporting
A comprehensive report was constructed in Looker Studio. The report provides data-driven recommendations based on the predictive modelâ€™s findings. These recommendations can be used to inform strategies for improving employee retention.

## Tech Stack
The tech stack used for this project includes:
- Google BigQuery
- Python
- PyCaret
- Google Sheets
- Google Looker Studio

These tools were instrumental in analyzing the data, conducting the pilot program, engineering the predictive model, and constructing the report. They provide a robust and flexible platform for carrying out complex data analysis and predictive modeling tasks. 

## Challenges
One of the challenges faced during this project was the use of Looker Studio. As it was not used extensively before, there was a learning curve involved. However, by diligently following the documentation, the challenge was successfully overcome.
